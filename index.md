# booklist.media

The [booklist.media](https://booklist.media) site is a hobby project I've created to teach myself skills for developing and maintaining software projects.  This site is a repository for documentation about the project.  The code for the site as well as this doc is all open source under [APL-2.0](LICENSE), but I'm not looking for any contributions or unsolicited help.
